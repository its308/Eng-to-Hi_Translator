# Translator Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, `Translator.ipynb`, which demonstrates a text translation pipeline using state-of-the-art NLP models. The notebook guides you through loading a pre-trained translation model, processing input text, and generating translated output interactively.

## Features

- **Pre-trained Model Usage:** Leverages pre-trained translation models (e.g., from the Hugging Face Transformers library).
- **Interactive Workflow:** Step-by-step demonstration in a Jupyter Notebook.
- **Customizable Pipeline:** Easily modify input text, model settings, and output formatting.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/translator-notebook.git
   cd translator-notebook
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers jupyterlab
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open `Translator.ipynb`:**

   - Navigate to the `Translator.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface.
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook.

3. **Translate Text:**

   - Input your text in the designated cell.
   - Run the cell to see the translation generated by the model.

## Customization

- **Model Selection:**  
  The notebook uses a default pre-trained translation model, but you can change this to any model available on the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

- **Pipeline Adjustments:**  
  You can modify the preprocessing steps, tokenization, or output formatting to suit your needs.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter memory or performance issues, consider running the notebook on a machine with a dedicated GPU or using cloud-based environments.
- Ensure that all required libraries are installed and up-to-date.
